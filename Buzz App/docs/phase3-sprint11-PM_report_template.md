### Project Management
Self-evaluation of PM performance

1. When did your team meet with your mentor, and for how long?
    * Friday 10am for 20 minutes.
1. Describe your use of Trello.  Did you have too much detail?  Too little?  Just enough? Did you implement policies around its use (if so, what were they?)?
    * I have many small tasks with just enough detail
    * I added labels for each card to imply the risk of it and which role it belongs to.
1. How did you conduct team meetings?  How did your team interact outside of these meetings?
    * I think our meeting is effective. We complete our ERD, system diagram and state mechine together and checked with Ayon.
    * We communication actively outside the meeting using messages and slack. 
1. What techniques (daily check-ins/scrums, team programming, timelines, Trello use, group design exercises) did you use to mitigate risk?
    * I use trello to remind everyone about each task they need to do and set a deadline for each task.
    * I check the progress with each member everyday to make sure that they are not behind and if they have any problems, we can solve it together.
1. Describe any difficulties you faced in managing the interactions among your teammates? Were there any team issues that arose?
    * I think there are too many tech debt for Web for phase 2 but everyone works hard to complete their own works
1. How well did you estimate time during the early part of the phase?  How did your time estimates change as the phase progressed?
    * I think all of our members spent around 4 hours on their work and I think this time many increase as the phase progressed because we need to fix all the tech debt.
1. What aspects of the project would cause concern for your customer right now, if any?
    * I think running on dokku will be a headache. Web have too many tech debt for phase2.
1. What is your biggest concern as you think ahead to the next phase of the project?
    * This phase is actually the last phase.
1. Describe the most significant obstacle or difficulty your team faced.
