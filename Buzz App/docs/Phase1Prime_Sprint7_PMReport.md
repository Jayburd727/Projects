## Beginning of Phase 1' [20 points]
Report out on the Phase 1 backlog and any technical debt accrued during Phase 1.

1. What required Phase 1 functionality was not implemented and why? 
    * We do not have our backend or web-front end runnning on Dokku yet. There were issues with this process during phase 1, so we put it off until this week. 
    * While everyone has unit tests, we are also working on improving them and implementing more.
    * Everything else is implemented correctly, we are moving forward with removing tech debt. 
1. What technical debt did the team accrue during Phase 1?
    * The backend's techincal debt was not having Dokku up and running. 
    * Admin had his unit tests in the improper location and had improper port locations 
    * Web also had the techincal debt of the front-end not being set up on Dokku yet. 
    * Mobile had the techincal debt of not being connected to the backend, and not being set up to run on Dokku. The app was also no able to rotate orientation, nor refresh easily. 


## End of Phase 1' [20 points]
Report out on the Phase 1' backlog.

1. What required Phase 1 functionality still has not been implemented or is not operating properly and why?
    * All functionality has been implemented, but there are some minor bugs when running on Dokku
1. What technical debt remains?
    * Web is running on Dokku, but there is a bug that needs to be identified and fixed, so there is an issue about 25% of the time when we run it on Dokku. Working on removing that currently. 
    * Mobile is also experiencing some bugs from Dokku. Working on finalizing that process as well. 


## Role reporting [50 points]
Report-out on each team members' activity, from the PM perspective (you may seek input where appropriate, but this is primarily a PM related activity).

1. If there was any remaining Phase 1 functionality that needed to be implemented in Phase 1', what did the PM do to assist in the effort of getting this functionality implemented and operating properly?
    * I made sure to check in on the team as they were working toward getting everything running on Dokku. I consistently asked if people needed any help or if we should ask Ayon for any guidance. Everyone said they were good and they did not need help. I also made sure to connect people when they needed to be working together. For example, I connected Jack and Alonso for their unit tests, and Jonah, Mo, and Alonso for the Dokku work. 

### Back-end
What did the back-end developer do during Phase 1'?  

    * Alonso worked on improving his unit tests, making sure our backend was runnning on Dokku, and removing any technical debt that he saw. The Dokku connection took a lot of work, and he was very helpful making sure that everyone was able to connect.  

### Admin
What did the admin front-end developer do during Phase 1'?  

    * Jack worked on creating his artifact as instructed in the deliverables, and also listed and corrected any technical debt that he found in his code. 

### Web
What did the web front-end developer do during Phase 1'?  

    * Jonah worked on connceting the web front end to Dokku. This took a lot of time as there were a lot of small hiccups along the way. Once that was complete he identified any tech debt he had and started to work on his artifcact for the week. 

### Mobile
What did the mobile front-end developer do during Phase 1'?  

* Mo also had to work on connecting the web front end to Dokku. This process was very time consuming and Mo was always willing to meet with others to figure out the issues they were having. Once Mo was done with that he got started on identifying tech debt in his code and creating his artifact. Also, Mo worked on getting the app to do a slide refresh and be able to lock into a prefered orientation. 

### Project Management
Self-evaluation of team performance

1. When did your team meet with your mentor, and for how long?
    * Our team met with Ayon on Friday morning for about 20 minutes. 
1. Describe how the team worked together in Phase 1'. Were all members engaged? Was the work started early in the week or was there significant procrastination?
    * Our team worked mostly asynchronously, but made sure to keep each other updated via trello and texting. I did frequent check in's to make sure I knew where people were at and that we were on pace to complete everything by our Saturday timeline. We worked together on Friday and Saturday synchronously before creating the video to make sure every had what they needed and that the artifacts were in the right place. 
1. Describe any concerns you have about the prospects for success moving forward? What steps can the team take to reduce your concern?
    * My concern is with our communication. We respond when asked, but I believe that moving forward we need to be a little bit more proactive about updating each other where we are and making sure we get started earlier in the week. Things are going to get harder in upcoming phases and I think we're going to need to be more open and honest with each other.
