## General questions [25 points]

1. How well did the team meet the requirements of this sprint?
    * We met all of the requirements for this sprint as instructed by our mentor. We have our web front-end running and have successfully set up our backend on Dokku. We have created the designs needed to know how to move forward with further implementation. Web and mobile have a good base to build off of and are aware of how to move forward in implementation. Backend has worked on further implementation and feels very good about his progress. Admin feels he met the requirements for this sprint, but will need to focus on the design to have direction moving forward. 
1. When is the team gathering for a weekly, in-person meeting(s)? If not, why not?
    * We meet in person on Friday mornings in the CITL.
1. Report on each member's progress (phase activity completion) – "what is the status?"
    * Web has a running front-end that is successfully ran locally. Has a list of tests that he will implement as he progresses with his code. 
    * Backend has dokku set up and successfully working. 
    * Admin has created the user stories and is working on creating the stand-alone java program for adding and dropping tables. He has worked on implementing unit tests for when the add/drop tables methods are created.  
    * Mobile has a default app up and running. Has a list of tests that he will implement as he progresses with his code.
1. Summary of "code review" during which each team member discussed and showed their progress – "how did you confirm the status?"
    * All code reviews were either done in person or during out meeting on zoom on Sunday. This allowed me to see that things were running properly. 
    * During the web code review I was able to see the web-front end was created in REACT and was successfully run locally. We tested that updated in the App.js file were reflected onto the web-front end and that was successful. I did this code review in person so was able to see all of this happening. 
    * During the backend code review I was able to see that he has his app.java created and his test folder. He also has his pom.xml created and has descriptions of tests for all of these files. 
    * During the mobile code review I was able to see the default app was created and launched successfully. The app is the same as the default one from the tutorials, so there is functionality that will need to be added. Verified the status by seeing him launch the code in person and display the app. 
    * During the admin code review I saw that Jack created the basic files from teh admin tutorial. He has a lot of work ahead to create the standalone java file for adding and dropping tables, but he has also started to implement code for unit tests once those functions are added. 
1. What did you do to encourage the team to be working on phase activities "sooner rather than later"?
    * I texted and messaged in SLACK the tasks for the team to do and make sure they looked at our Trello board for tentative due dates for each part. This encouraged them do get their tasks done thorughout the week and make progress.
1. What did you do to encourage the team to help one another? 
    * I encouraged web and mobile to work together since their parts are closely related. I also made sure we collaborated on the artifacts so we were all on the same page of how we should move forward. 
1. How well is the team communicating?
    * We are communicating fairly well. Hoping to get people used to using Trello for updates moving forward, but we have been texting with updates and issues we may be facing. 
1. What expectations have you set for one another, if any? Highlight any changes.
    * We have improved at expecting each other to communicate better and keep each other updated on progress. We expect that everyone continues to show up to meetings and be engaged. Lastly, we have started setting tentative due dates and we expect that people put effort forth to meet those. 
1. If anything was especially challenging or unclear, please itemize and briefly describe the challenge, its status (resolved or unresolved), and critical steps taken to find resolution.  
    * There were no major challlenges. Expectations for this sprint were a little unclear based off of instructions, but our mentor helped clear things up. 


## Project Management [25 points]
Self-evaluation of PM performance

1. When did your team meet with your mentor, and for how long?
    * We met with Ayon on Friday morning for about 20 minutes. 
1. Describe your use of Trello.  Did you have too much detail?  Too little?  Just enough? Did you implement policies around its use (if so, what were they?)?  
    * We have been using Trello a good amount. At first I put too broad of tasks on there because I was looking at the entire phase instead of just this sprint. However, I changed that on Tuesday and made the tasks much smaller and easier to digest and understand what is required. I requested that the group update Trello, or text me to let me know where they were so I could update Trello. I continued to remind people throughout the week, and that has been working. 
1. How did you conduct team meetings?  How did your team interact outside of these meetings?  
    * We worked well together in class to understand what was expected of us. After each class period I had a short list of things that needed to be done and had our next meeting time scheduled. When we met on Friday we collaborated to work on the diagrams and we made sre everyone knew what was expected of them and how we would move forward. We also set a final meeting time for Sunday to finalize the pull requests and make the video together. Outside of meetings we communicated a lot to update each other on progress. We had a few members get sick this week so that was a challenge, but other than that we communicated and worked together well. 
1. What techniques (daily check-ins/scrums, team programming, timelines, Trello use, group design exercises) did you use to mitigate risk?  
    * I checked in with individuals every other day to check where they were. These occurred either in class or over slack/text. I created timelines on Trello and asked people to keep the Trello board updated which worked well. 
1. Describe any difficulties you faced in managing the interactions among your teammates? Were there any team issues that arose?  
    * Our only issue was that a few team members got sick this week and one member was travelling on the weekend. It was hard not having everyone together in one place until Sunday, but we communicated a lot throughout the week which helped.
1. How well did you estimate time during the early part of the phase?  How did your time estimates change as the phase progressed?  
    * We estimated time really well. I think we were really productive when we came together which allowed us to use the time gained from that to implement code individually as needed. 
1. What aspects of the project would cause concern for your customer right now, if any?  
    * There isn't any ability to post or comment anything at this point. There is not a ton of functionality to display which could be concerning. 
1. What is your biggest concern as you think ahead to the next sprint?  
    * Making sure that all team members commit to showing up to class and continue to prioritize this class. 
1. Describe the most significant obstacle or difficulty your team faced.  
    * As mentioned before, the biggest obstacle was not being able to get everyone on the team together in one spot until Sunday. It make communicating and holding each other accountable harder, but we still managed and people stepped up.
