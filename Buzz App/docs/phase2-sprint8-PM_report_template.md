## General questions [25 points]

1. How well did the team meet the requirements of this sprint?
    * Trello Cards were made using the sprint description and rubrics; hence, all objectives were addressed and all implementations done effectively on time.
    * Each member of the team did his/her part and contributed to design of the multiple diagrams.
    * Given the complexity of implementation and to avoid going into the scope of next phase the unit tests do not actually run and are rather a sort of pseudocode that reflects the future implementation.
    * Mobile and Web had merge conflicts but fortunatly all solved in the end.
    * Design looks good, complete and simple while backend now has a clear structure and path to follow for implementation.

1. When is the team gathering for a weekly, in-person meeting(s)? If not, why not?
    * Friday 10am in Zoom for this week with mentor
    * Sunday 12pm to start with backend for next phase.
    * Sunday 9pm for recodrding and planing.
1. Report on each member's progress (phase activity completion) – "what is the status?"
    * Backend: Clear plan and implementation of SQL functionalities in progress.
    * Mobile/Web: Understanding of routes and clear UI implementation plan defined
    * Admin: Clear plan for tests and coordinating with backend for matching the respective SQL functionalities.
1. Summary of "code review" during which each team member discussed and showed their progress – "how did you confirm the status?"
    * First asked them to explain their implementation plan.
    * Second I asked to explain their test cases based on that plan.
    * Third, I analyzed if there is logic in the plan and try to project to see the "final product" and review the code for syntax errors.
    * Finally, I congratulate for the work and proceed to accept the pull request
1. What did you do to encourage the team to be working on phase activities "sooner rather than later"?
    * It was a complicated week for everyone, but all was delivered on time. Previous PM did an amazing job in establishing the culture of doing things as soon as possible.
    * Thinking in next phase I encourage backend to have her part ideally by tuesday night.
1. What did you do to encourage the team to help one another?
    * Generate dynamic conversation not necesarily related to the course. That helps to make a better working enviroment and indirectly strongly motivates members to help each other.
1. How well is the team communicating?
    * Very well by slack and text group.
1. What expectations have you set for one another, if any? Highlight any changes.
    * Backend to have all her part by Tuesday night (Except for tests)
    * Mobile/Web/Admin ready by Friday Night
    * Get feedback on friday mentor meeting, do updates and record on sunday morning
1. If anything was especially challenging or unclear, please itemize and briefly describe the challenge, its status (resolved or unresolved), and critical steps taken to find resolution.
    * Nothing for this phase
    * Tech Debt: Connect web in dokku does not display main page or index (Unresolved). We will organize a meeting on Friday to address that specific point between ALL GROUP Members.

## Project Management [25 points]
Self-evaluation of PM performance

1. When did your team meet with your mentor, and for how long?
    * Friday 10am for 20 minutes
1. Describe your use of Trello.  Did you have too much detail?  Too little?  Just enough? Did you implement policies around its use (if so, what were they?)?
    * Many small tasks in much detail (Except for video that had multiple task as a checklist)
    * Cards had an assign person and the ones that not were worked by ALL the team
1. How did you conduct team meetings?  How did your team interact outside of these meetings?
    * Before each team meeting we set clear objectives so we tried to address them directly at meetings and finish ASAP.
    * Outside meeting we solved our doubts by direct message.
    * End meetings with a funny remark or conversation.
1. What techniques (daily check-ins/scrums, team programming, timelines, Trello use, group design exercises) did you use to mitigate risk?
    * We did team programming for merging work from differente roles and to make the diagrams.
    * Trello to check our objetcives.
    * Bi-daily checks on the progress of each member.
1. Describe any difficulties you faced in managing the interactions among your teammates? Were there any team issues that arose?
    * No difficulties, we get along very well.
1. How well did you estimate time during the early part of the phase?  How did your time estimates change as the phase progressed?
    * Development time of around 3 hours was accurate but not starting time given that the week was very loaded (External factors) for many members.
1. What aspects of the project would cause concern for your customer right now, if any?
    * Web front-end not running on Dokku, although we have currently an action plan to address that issue.
1. What is your biggest concern as you think ahead to the next sprint?
    * Time and technical complexity of the implementation particularly for backend.
1. Describe the most significant obstacle or difficulty your team faced.
    * Time given that upcoming week many members have midterms.
